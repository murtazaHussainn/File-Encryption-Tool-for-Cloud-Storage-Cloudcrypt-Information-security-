#Introduction 
CloudCrypt is a Python-based desktop application that provides secure file encryption and decryption 
functionality integrated with cloud storage services, specifically Dropbox. The application offers users 
the ability to encrypt files using the AES encryption algorithm, upload them to Dropbox, and later 
download and decrypt them as needed. CloudCrypt aims to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of 
users' files during storage and transmission over the internet. 

#Project Overview 
The CloudCrypt project utilizes the tkinter library for building the graphical user interface (GUI), 
integrating it with various other libraries such as dropbox for cloud storage and Crypto.Cipher for AES 
encryption. The application provides a user-friendly interface divided into two tabs: Encryption and 
Decryption. 

#Encryption Tab 
In the Encryption tab, users can select the encryption algorithm (currently only supporting AES), choose 
the file to encrypt, enter an encryption key, and initiate the encryption process. Upon encryption, the 
file is uploaded to the user's Dropbox account along with encryption metadata. 

#Decryption Tab 
In the Decryption tab, users can download encrypted files from Dropbox, enter the decryption key, and 
decrypt the files. The application retrieves encryption metadata from a file provided by the sender to 
ensure successful decryption. 

#Functionality Overview 

#Encryption 
1. Select Encryption Algorithm: Users can choose the encryption algorithm (currently supporting 
AES). 
2. Select File: Users can browse and select the file they want to encrypt. 
3. Enter Encryption Key: Users must enter an encryption key to encrypt the file. 
4. Encrypt and Upload: Initiates the encryption process, uploads the encrypted file to Dropbox, and 
saves encryption metadata.

#Decryption 
1. Download and Decrypt: Users can download encrypted files from Dropbox, enter the decryption 
key, and decrypt the files. The application retrieves encryption metadata to facilitate decryption.

#User Interface 
The GUI of CloudCrypt is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, with a clean layout and clear 
instructions provided at each step of the encryption and decryption processes. The Encryption and 
Decryption tabs allow users to easily switch between the two functionalities.

#Conclusion 
CloudCrypt provides a convenient solution for users to encrypt and decrypt files securely using AES 
encryption and seamlessly integrate with Dropbox for cloud storage. With its intuitive interface and 
robust functionality, CloudCrypt offers users peace of mind knowing that their files are protected during 
storage and transmission.
